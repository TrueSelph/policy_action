## How to Use

Below is detailed guidance on how to configure and use the Policy Action.

### Overview

The Policy Action provides a mechanism for serving AI policy documents. It supports configurations for various use cases, including:

- **Dynamic content generation** based on agent-specific data.
- **Integration** with JIVAS agents for seamless policy management.

---

### Configuration Structure

The configuration consists of the following components:

### `policy_settings`

Defines the settings for the policy content, such as placeholders and dynamic replacements.

```python
policy_settings = {
    "agent_name": "example_agent",  # Example: "example_agent"
    "content": "Your policy content here."  # Policy content template
}
```

---

### Example Configurations

### Basic Configuration for Policy Content

```python
policy_settings = {
    "agent_name": "TrueSelph",
    "content": """
    # AI Policy - {agent_name}
    This is a sample policy document for {agent_name}.
    """
}
```

### Best Practices
- Ensure placeholders in the content are replaced dynamically.
- Test the policy content rendering in a staging environment before production use.
